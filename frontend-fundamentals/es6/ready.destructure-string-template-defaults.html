       Create an arrow function that receives a single object as a parameter:
       To solve this exercise you must use the following features from ES6:
       - To read the properties from the function parameter -> Object destructuring
       - For the first line of output -> String templates
       - Assign a default value of 'The Learning Inc' to the-> Default parameters

       The function should print the following (each line is a console.log):
          We present the book The joy of cooking by Quentin Fisher. The tags of this book are:
          vegan
          no gluten
          milenial
          easy
          and it was produced by The Learning Inc
